# Process
## Practices
We are following a srumban process where we are meeting each other for updates in scrum meetings. The notes from the meetings are provided in another section.
Following additional practices are followed in our process.
1. **Core Practice**: Pull requests are reviewed by atleast one team member before being merged to the master. This will help in aiding communication between team members and also prevents faulty code being merged to the master.
2. **Corollary Practice**: All the team members are allowed to contribute to any part of the code. Irrespective of the role they have been assigned.
## Roles of team members
The following are the roles assigned to each of the team members. (This doesn't restrict them from contributing to any part of the codebase)
* Aniruddha - (Development Engineer)
* Suraj - (Development Engineer)
* Sanjana - (Automation and Q/A Engineer)
* Archit - (Development Engineer)
